        I am a passionate student, I love developing new products and participating in projects that allow me to grow as a professional, so I am always active on websites like GitHub where I can share and get inspired with ideas from developers from all around the world.I can also spend hours and hours learning new skills that allow me to improve both my productivity and work performance. I think the world of web development is like a book that tells a never-ending story.

        I have participated in the development of applications such as Toys Market place, Raibu On and Ravenous. I have mainly worked as a lead developer, covering functions of fullstack developer. However, my strong point is the front-end, because I am a professional musician and son of two great artists who taught me the beauty of art. That's why I consider myself a lover of colors and fairy tales.
